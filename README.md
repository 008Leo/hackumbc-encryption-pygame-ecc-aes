This code was for the **hackUMBC 2023 hackathon.** `client1.py` and `server1.py` are the encrypted chat modules. `main.py` is the fighter game.
**Please rename idea to .idea if you are downloading, as I am unable to upload a hidden directory to GitHub.** Also, you will need to:

  -Generate your own `Fernet` key, as well as your own SSL key and certificates. In the code, you will find what to name your keys.
  
  -Download the necessary modules.
  
  -Replace (REDACTED) in `client1.py` with the correct IP.
